# nonattracting_regions_of_local_minima
Python notebooks with experiments showing the existence of non-attracting regions of local minima in wide networks. 

"Notebook Construction of non-attracting regions of local minima in deep and wide networks.ipynb" contains the construction of a degenerate suboptimal local minimum in 3-layer network of size 2--n--n--1 with n larger than the number of training samples.


"Construction of non-attracting regions of local minima in deep and wide networks by adding neurons to the last layer.ipynb" contains a slightly less degenerate samples where the last hidden layer is arbitrarily wide.

"Checking condtions for D and B in deeper network.ipynb" contains experiments on checking conditions that allow the construction of suboptimal minima in networks.
